CEH Engage - Part I
Part 1 of CEH Engage covers Footprinting and Reconnaissance, Scanning Networks, Enumeration, and Vulnerability Analysis modules. In this part, you are required to perform passive and active reconnaissance of the target organization, enumerating services, shares, users, user groups, etc., and perform vulnerability analysis of the identified systems/networks on the target. You need to note all the information discovered in this part of the CEH Engage and proceed to the subsequent phases of the ethical hacking cycle in the next part of the CEH Engage.

Flags
Challenge 1:

An attacker conducted footprinting on a web application and saved the resulting report Dumpster.xlsx in the documents folder of EH Workstation-1. Your task is to analyze this report and identify the hostname associated with the IP address 173.245.59.176. (Format: aaaaa.aa.aaaaaaaaaa.aaa)

Challenge 2:

Identify the number of live machines excluding the gateway in 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. (Format: N)

Challenge 3:

Identify the IP address of a Linux-based machine with port 22 open in the target network 192.168.10.0/24 (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN).

Challenge 4:

Find the IP address of the Domain Controller machine in 192.168.0.0/24. (Format: NNN.NNN.N.NNN)

Challenge 5:

Perform a host discovery scanning and identify the NetBIOS_Domain_Name of the host at 192.168.0.222. (Format: AAAAA.AAA)

Challenge 6:

Perform an intense scan on 192.168.0.222 and find out the DNS_Tree_Name of the machine in the network. (Format: AAAAA.AAA.aaa)

Challenge 7:

While performing a security assessment against the CEHORG network, you came to know that one machine in the network is running OpenSSH and is vulnerable. Identify the version of the OpenSSH running on the machine. Note: Target network 192.168.10.0/24. (Format: N.NaN)

Challenge 8:

During a security assessment, it was found that a server was hosting a website that was susceptible to blind SQL injection attacks. Further investigation revealed that the underlying database management system of the site was MySQL. Determine the machine OS that hosted the database. Note: Target network 172.30.10.0/24 (Format: Aaaaaa)

Challenge 9:

Perform an intense scan on target subnet 192.168.10.0/24 and determine the IP address of the machine hosting the MSSQL database service. (Format: NNN.NNN.NN.NNN)

Challenge 10:

Perform a DNS enumeration on www.certifiedhacker.com and find out the name servers used by the domain. (Format: aaN.aaaaaaaa.aaa, aaN.aaaaaaaa.aaa)

Challenge 11:

Find the IP address of the machine running SMTP service on the 172.30.10.0/24 network. (Format: NNN.NN.NN.NNN)

Challenge 12:

Perform an SMB Enumeration on 172.30.10.200 and check whether the Message signing feature is required. Give your response as Yes/No.

Yes
No
Challenge 13:

Conduct a Common Weakness Enumeration on the Weakness ID 276 and identify the name associated with the ID. (Format: Aaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaaaa)

Challenge 14:

Perform vulnerability scanning for the Linux host in the 192.168.10.0/24 network using OpenVAS and find the QoD percentage of vulnerabilitiy with severity level as medium. (Format: NN)

Challenge 15:

Perform a vulnerability scan on the host at 192.168.10.144 using OpenVAS and identify any FTP-related vulnerability. (Format: AAA Aaaaaaaaa Aaaaaaaaa Aaaaa )
